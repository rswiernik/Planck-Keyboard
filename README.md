# Planck-Keyboard
This repo contains my designs for any physical pieces surrounding the Planck Keyboard. These designs are released with the Apache License. The designs in this repo will work with one another, and should work with the switch plate and case from [ortholinearkeyboards.com](ortholinearkeyboards.com).
